* categories

Additionally, Slate+Simple supports [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) for beautiful equations and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). LaTeX math wrapped in `$$` will automatically compile to in-line or block images of formatted equations. Font awesome icons are included with the `i` tag. For example: `<i class='fa fa-github-alt'></i>`.
